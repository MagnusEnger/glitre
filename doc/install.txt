Installing Glitre

This document will tell you how to get Glitre up and running. 

Commands that should be given on the command line are prefixed with a ">". 

*** ASSUMPTIONS

This installation guide will take as it's starting point a very basic install of Debian 6. 

It assumes you have sudo privileges on the machine. 

*** GETTING GLITRE

The source code for Glitre can be retrieved from this site: 
https://github.com/glitre/glitre

There are two main options: 

1. Download a packaged version

Choose either .tar.gz or .zip: 

.tar.gz

> wget -O glitre.tar.gz --no-check-certificate https://github.com/glitre/glitre/tarball/master
> tar -xvf glitre.tar.gz

.zip

> wget -O glitre.zip --no-check-certificate https://github.com/glitre/glitre/zipball/master
> unzip glitre.zip

You may have to install unzip before doing this: 

> sudo apt-get install unzip

Unpack the package of your choice, and you have a snapshot of the code. The snapshot will
probably be in a directory called something like glitre-glitre-490f44e - you might want to 
rename this before proceeding: 

> mv glitre-glitre-490f44e glitre

2. Use Git - recommended

With Git you have an easy way to update Glitre, and it's easy to make and track local 
changes, and share them with the world, if you feel so inclined. 

First of all you need to install Git: 

> sudo apt-get install git-core git-doc

You can now clone the Glitre repository:

> git clone git://github.com/glitre/glitre.git

This will create a directory called "glitre" below your current directory. 

*** PREREQUISITES

If you want to run Glitre as a standalone you will need to install Apache and PHP. 
(You might want to do this if you want to run Glitre on it's own server and just 
access the API.   

> sudo apt-get install apache2 php5 libapache2-mod-php5 php5-curl php-pear smarty

If you are integrating Glitre with e.g. a CMS, Apache and PHP will probably be in place 
already, but you might still need to install these: 

> sudo apt-get install php5-curl php-pear smarty

You need to install some PEAR modules:

> sudo pear install Cache_Lite
> sudo pear install File_MARC

Installing File_MARC will probably fail, follow the instructions and do something like 
this instead: 

> sudo pear install channel://pear.php.net/Structures_LinkedList-0.2.2
> sudo pear install channel://pear.php.net/File_MARC-0.6.2

*** CONFIGURE GLITRE

Rename inc.config-dist.php: 

> mv inc.config-dist.php inc.config.php

Edit inc.config.php with your favourite editor. Some sample libraries are included and should
work as is, but you might at least want to have a look at the base_path variable. 

*** USING GLITRE

If you want to use Glitre as an include, you can probably keep the files anywhere you want, 
and just include inc.glitre.php in your application. 

If you want to use Glitre's API you need to have it in a web accessible location. If you use
the default setup described above you could for example move the glitre folder to 
/var/www/glitre. This should make the API available as localhost/glitre/api/
